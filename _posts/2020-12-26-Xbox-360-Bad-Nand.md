I just happened to flash nand that was not compatible with RGH2 to my Xbox 360, and my Xbox no longer booted, it was stuck in a restart loop.

Since I flashed it via xbox itself (Simple360NandFlasher) and I wasn't able to boot to dashboard or xell, the only way to flash correct flash is through Xbox JTAG ports, with 

NAND-X

JR-Programmer

Which are the easiest and most fool proof methods.
There are also cheaper and more difficult methods:

Modified MTX SPI Nand Flasher:

Soldering LPT port:

Well I no longer have a pc with LPT ports, nor LPT to USB adapter and as far as I understood these adapters are mostly aimed for Printers and wouldn't work anyway.
Flashers would have taken too much time to get and I wanted to fix my xbox fast since it's holiday season, and I want to play games on it.

So I thought I have quite a few micro controllers, there surely must be a way to use them to flash my nand, so I started to dig has anyone done this with arduino or some other controllers, and sure enough found a jackpot
[walczakp/xbox360-teensy-flasher](https://github.com/walczakp/xbox360-teensy-flasher) repository. However I don't have any of Teensy boards so I had to port this code to one of the controllers that I had.

My choises are:
- Arduino Nano
- LGT8 Nano Compatible board
- STM32 Blue Pill
- ESP8266
- ESP32

I chose ESP32 because it required least effort to port code to.
I ported code from Arduino IDE project to PlatformIO because auto complete and easier to debug.
I don't remember all the changes I did because there were a lot of trial and error to make it work.
Reading nand was easy and straight forward, I did that within an hour however, writing was a different story, and I'm not sure now which changes are required and which are not but now it works so I'm happy :D

Here is the modified code: TODO

Here is how it looked:
